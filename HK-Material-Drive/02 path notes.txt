Installing JDK software:
=================
	1) Go to google.com -> search JDK 14 download -> click second link
	2) Click JDK download
	3) Click Windows JDK.exe
	4) Double click the downloded exe file
	5) Click Next 
	6) Click Change button -> remove "\program files\Java"
		and make installation path as "C:\jdk-14.0.2"
	7) Click Next -> Close/Finish
*** jdk-14 is installed in C:\jdk-14.0.2 folder
*** this jdk-14.0.2 is called JAVA_HOME

Different types of files exist in a software
==============================
When we install any software we will get two types of files
	1) binary files
	2) library files

	- binaray file is a command file using which we can run the current software 
		and also we can run other programs by using this software.
	
	- library file is a program file it contains logic to perform one operation
		and by using it we can develop our own programms. 

	- The library files are also called as API(Application Programming Interface)

	- by default binary files are stored in "bin" folder
	- by default library files are stored in "lib" folder

Some times we need to access and run a software binary and library files 
	from outside of this software installed directory from other folders from command prompt

Ofcourse we can not access them by default, because command prompt software does not know 
the path where those binary and library files are available in this system

We must tell to OS/cmd prompt the path of binary and library files.

For this purpose we must create some variables inside OS
for finding a software installed directory, its binary and library files
those variables are technically called environment variables.

About environment variables
====================
	A variable that is created inside OS for finding 
	a Software installed directory, its binary and library files is called env variable.

For Java software we have four env variables
	
	1) JAVA_HOME
	2) path
	3) classpath
	4) module-path

	- JAVA_HOME is used for finding JDK software installed directory
	- path is used for finding ANY software binary files 
	- classpath is used for find library files of JDK software, our project and Java related other sofwares classes
	- module-path is used for finding modules of JDK software, our project and Java related other sofwares modules

Note: 
1) JAVA_HOME, classpath and module-path are specific to Java software
	where as path is common to all softwares we are installing in the system, including OS

Who does use above environment variables?
===============================
- JAVA_HOME is set by programmer and it is used by server software (ex: tomcat)
- *** path is set by programmer and it is used by command prompt software for finding javac and java tools ***
- classpath and module-path are used by compiler and JVM for finding the classes and modules
	those available in other directories

Which environment variable is mandatory to set?
=================================
- As of now we must set path variable, it is mandatory
	because we need to access "javac and java" commands from our project directory

- We not need to set JAVA_HOME, classpath and module-path, they are optional.


Diff ways of Setting env variables
========================
We can set env variables in two ways
	1) temporarily	(at command promopt window)
	2) permanently (in system environment variables window)

	Temporary settings
	==============
	  1) Open cmd widow
	  2) run below command

		>set path=C:\jdk-14.0.1\bin;-------;--------;-------;%path%
				(Donot show your typing talent, Copy and Paste path values )
			
			Commands we use in setting env var temporarity
				1) set			-> creating and updating env variable
				2) ;				-> separating one software path to another s/w path
				3) %evn var%		-> for retrieving existing value of this env var
				4) echo %evn var%	-> for printing this env variable value

		The "set command" based setup is called temporary, because those setups are available
		only for this command prompt window. Once this command prompt window is closed
		all setups are lost. we must do same setups repeateadly every time when new cmd window opened

		Solution: permanent setup

	Permanent setups:
	=============
		1) Copy the JDK software "bin" folder path
		2) Right Click on "This PC"
		3) Click "Properties"
		4) Click "Advanced System Settings"
		5) Click "Envinorment Variables"
		6) In System Variables section
			1) Dobule click "path"

		In windows XP, 7, 8
			2) Press "Home" key on keyboard
			3) Paste the path you copied  (ctrl+v)
			4) Enter ";"
			5) Click "Ok" -> "OK"
			6) Close all windows

		In windows 10
			2) Click "New" button
			3) Paste the path you copied  (ctrl+v)
			4) Click "Move Up" and bring "Java path" as first path
			5) Click "Ok"
			6) Close all windows

		Rule: JDK path must be always first in path variable value
 		because other software(ex: Oracle) also contains inbuild JDK
		If we place our JDK path at end in path variable value,
			our JDK will not be used in compiling and executing our class.

OS searching algorithm for finding binary files
================================
	CWD --> if not available -> Path variable -> First Come First Load (FCFL)  (Left -->Right Seaching in path variable)

	Q1) In one computer how many JDK softwares can we install?
		Mulitiple JDK of diff versions

	Q2) If we install mulitple diff versions of JDK from which version JDK javac and java will run?
		CWD or First placed JDK in path variable
			(Current Working Directory)

	Q3) How can we run Java program with different versions?
		- set one JDK path in permanent path, which you want to use always
		- set another JDK path in temporary setting in cmd window which you use for one time

	Q4) If  there are two JDK paths are stored in path variable, which JDK will used?
		- First placed JDK	
	
	Q5) In path variable, I have placed jdk-14 version path, 
		and in cmd window, I have changed path (CWD) to jdk1.7,
			then which version javac will be used?
		- 1.7 vesion will be used (first priority to CWD)

	Q6) Can we set mulitple JDKs in Permanent Path?
		- Yes, but no use, because it follows FCFE
		- If we palce mutiple JDKs in PP no problem
			but only first placed JDK is used.

	Q7) We never to set path for game software to run,
		why do we need to set path for JDK to run?
		- We no need to set path for game software, 
			because we do not run game software binary files from cmd window

		- We must set path for JDK,
			because we need to run javac and java from cmd window from our 
			project directory
		
	Q8) Summary: When, we must set path for any software?
		- if we need to access any software binary files 
			from cmd prompt window from outside of software installed directory
			 we must set path.

		- If we no need to access a sotfware binary files from cmd window
			from other directories, we no need to set path

	Q9) Can we run javac and java like game software?
		- not possible because they are not GUI based programs
		- they are CUI based programs, they must be executed only from cmd promt window
			- GUI means Graphical User Interface, a separate window will open 
			- CUI means Console User Interface, a separate window will not there
				to run it needs console to run means cmd window
	
	Q10) If we develop programs by using IDEs (Eclipse, MyEclipse, Netbeans, intelliJ, JBuilder, etc...)
		do we need to set path, classpath?
			- No, not require
			- IDE will take care of all required setup

			IDE -> Integraged Development Environment
			It is editor software, which has advanced features
				for fast development
