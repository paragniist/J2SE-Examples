Step #1: Open notepad

Step #2: Type below print statement
				print("Welcome to HKProgrammingWorld!")

Step #3: Save above program with the name Example.py
         in the folder D:\01CJ\01JB

Step #4: Open cmd prompt 

Step #5: Change path to D:\01CJ\JB
				
Step #6: Directly run python program as shown below

				D:\01CJ\01JB>python Example.py
				Welcome to HKProgrammingWorld!

				D:\01CJ\01JB>py Example.py
				Welcome to HKProgrammingWorld!

				D:\01CJ\01JB>Example.py
				Welcome to HKProgrammingWorld!

Note: We no need to compile python program 
because it is scripting style programming lagauge

In scripting sytle we no need to write 
class and main method. We can place logic 
directly in the file.

In Python we can also write program 
	- in procedure programming style like in C language
	- in object-oriented style like in Java

In above two approaches, like in C and in Java 
in python main method is not automatically executed 
by PVM, we must call it explicity. We will learn it
in next chapters.
