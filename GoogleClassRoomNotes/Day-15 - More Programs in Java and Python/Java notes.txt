1. Softwares Required to Develop a Java and Python Program
    We need 3 softwares to develop, compile and execute a Java program
	1. Editor software	-> For developing a Java program means to Type and Save a Java program
			1. Basic Editor								-> Notepad
			2. Advanced Editor							-> Notepad++, Textpad, Editplus, Brackets
			3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)	-> Eclipse, STS, Intellij
		
		First learning programs development
			On Notepad -> Editplus -> Eclipse
		Note: Eclipse is not meant for learning, it is meant for developing project
	
	2. JDK, Python	-> For obtaining [Compiler, JVM and API] for developing, compile and execute a program
	
	3. Command prompt -> For running Compiler and JVM softwares for compiling and executing Java program
	
	- We have all three softwares Notepad, JDK and CMD prompt in our system.
	- Also we have set path to JDK software to access its binary files javac and java from our project directory
	- Now can develop programs and projects
2. Essential statements to develop a Java program
    - We have three essential statements in a java program development
	1. class
	2. main method
	3. System.out.println()
	
    - class is essential because Java is an OOP langauge. So in Java every program must be started with a class.

    - main method is essential because every Java program execution is started with main method. 
      The main method is the initial point of a class execution. From a class JVM executes only main method, 
      hence in a class we must define main method for execution. Just for compilation, main method is not required.

    - System.out.println() is essential because In Java, we can display any message or value (output or result)
	on console to end-user by using the print statement System.out.println(-);
3. Steps to develop a Java program
	1. Open notepad [Press start key -> type notepad -> press enter key]
	2. Type Java program
	3. Save this program with .java extension in project directory
	4. Open cmd prompt [Press start key -> type cmd -> press enter key]
	5. Change path to project directory
	6. Compile java file by using javac tool as	[ javac <filename>.java	]
	7. Execute class by using java tool as		[ java <classname>		]
4. Hello,World! Program development
	Step: 1. Open Notepad
	
	Step #2: Type below program

			class FirstProgram {
			        public static void main(String[] args) {
				        System.out.println("Welcome to HKProgrammingWorld!");
                                }
                        }

	Step #3: Save above program with name Example.java
		      in the folder D:\01CJ\01JB 
		      [this folder is not available in your system, you must create it]

	Step #4: Open cmd prompt
			C:\Users\HK>

			C:\Users\HK>javac Example.java
						error: file not found: Example.java	

	Step #5: Change path to project directory D:\01CJ\01JB
			C:\Users\HK>D:       (changing drive )
			D:\>
			
			D:\>cd 01CJ\01JB   (changing directory path) 
			D:\01CJ\01JB>

	Step #6: Compile Example.java file by using javac tool
			D:\01CJ\01JB>javac Example.java	
							|-> FirstProgram.class

	Step #7: Execute FirstProgram.class by using java tool
			D:\01CJ\01JB>java FirstProgram   [donot give .class extension, JVM automatically takes it]
							|-> Welcome to HKProgrammingWorld!
